> Source code for my Web-Based Programming (M0114) final project entry.

## About

This is the source code for the final project entry of my Web-Based Programming (M0114) course. It has been slightly modified from the original submitted version to clean up all the rough edges.

## Developing & running locally

Requirements:
* Ruby (v2.0.0+)
* Bundler
  (included from within Rails (`gem install rails`), or `gem install bundler`)
* Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com/>
  (install from within Ruby: `gem install jekyll`)
* Node.js
  (Jekyll requires the Node.js runtime to work)

Clone it. ( `git clone https://github.com/resir014/m0114-final-project.git` )

Then install all the bundled Rubygems.

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Simply running `bundle` also works. You can also run `bundle update` to update your gems

After the plugins are installed, we can now run a local server from within our computer.

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Head over to `localhost:4000` to view the site.
